Chalanges Faced:
The vast scope of the given DSA topics, coupled with the tight deadline, presented significant challenges. The sheer volume of topics made it difficult to maintain a consistent pace and fully grasp every concept. Additionally, my unfamiliarity of certain topics, such as the Fractional Knapsack Problem, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Bellman-Ford Algorithm, required extra time for understanding and implementation. While I attempted to practice LeetCode problems as much as possible, the time constraints often limited my ability to dedicate sufficient time to coding exercises. To aid in learning and retention, 

I documented my learnings and thought process using comments within my code.
